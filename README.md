🌟 Introduction
CareFlow is a patient-facing web application designed to run on kiosks in a hospital lobby. It tackles the confusion and stress of hospital visits by providing a simple, intuitive, and multi-language interface for core patient services. From getting a consultation token to booking a bed, CareFlow streamlines the entire process, reducing wait times and improving patient satisfaction.

This project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6), focusing on a clean, responsive design and a robust, object-oriented application structure without relying on external frameworks.

✨ Core Features
The application is packed with features designed to create a seamless patient journey:

📊 AI OPD Forecast: Displays a real-time prediction of patient traffic and average wait times, helping manage expectations.

🛌 Live Bed Availability & Booking: Shows the number of available beds across all wards and allows users to book a bed through an interactive dialog, complete with special service add-ons and multiple payment options.

🌐 Multi-Language Support: Full internationalization with support for English, Hindi, Tamil, and Malayalam. The entire UI, including doctor names, dynamically updates based on user selection.

👨‍⚕️ Dynamic Doctor List: Patients can view a list of available doctors, filter them by department, and see their status (Available, Busy, Not Arrived) and precise location (Room & Floor).

🎟️ Smart Token System:

General OPD Token: A large, prominent button for patients who need to see the next available doctor.

Doctor-Specific Token: Option to get a token for a specific doctor directly from their listing.

🚨 Emergency Alert System: A dedicated "Emergency" button that triggers a high-priority alert modal, instructing the user to proceed to the ER immediately.

👋 On-Demand Help Desk: A floating "Help Desk" button that assures users a staff member is on their way to provide assistance.

💳 Flexible Payment Options: The bed booking system simulates payment via UPI/QR Code or provides clear instructions for paying with cash at a designated machine.

🛠️ Tech Stack
This project is intentionally kept simple and accessible, using only core web technologies.

HTML5: For the semantic structure and layout of the application.

CSS3: For all styling, responsiveness, and the modern, clean user interface.

JavaScript (ES6): For all application logic, including the translation engine, state management, and dynamic DOM manipulation. All logic is encapsulated within a single CareFlowApp class for clean, maintainable code.

🚀 Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/careflow-kiosk.git](https://github.com/your-username/careflow-kiosk.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd careflow-kiosk

Open the index.html file:
Since this is a vanilla web project with no build steps, you can simply open the index.html file directly in your web browser.

⚙️ How It Works
The application's logic is self-contained and managed primarily by the CareFlowApp class in app.js.

Class-Based Architecture: All functionality, data, and state are managed within the CareFlowApp class.

State Management: The application's state (doctor lists, bed availability, etc.) is stored in a this.data object. This would be replaced with API calls in a real-world scenario.

Translation Engine: The this.translations object holds all the language strings. The setLanguage() method dynamically updates the text content of all elements with a data-lang attribute.

Event-Driven UI: The application is fully interactive. All buttons and inputs have event listeners that call specific methods within the class to open modals, filter data, or update the UI.

💡 Future Enhancements
This project serves as a strong foundation. Future improvements could include:

Backend Integration: Connect to a real backend (e.g., Firebase or a Node.js/Express server) to manage data dynamically.

Real-time Updates: Implement WebSockets to update doctor availability and queue numbers in real-time.

User Authentication: Add a simple login system for patients to view their appointment history.

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate a real payment gateway like Stripe or Razorpay.

Admin Dashboard: Create a separate interface for hospital staff to manage doctor schedules and patient queues.
